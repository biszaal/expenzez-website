# Requirements Document: AWS Backend Security & Architecture Audit

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive security audit and architecture review of the Expenzez AWS backend infrastructure. The system is currently live in production on the App Store, requiring careful consideration for implementing security improvements without service disruption. The audit will identify security vulnerabilities, architectural inefficiencies, CloudFormation resource limitations, and establish a robust CI/CD pipeline for safe deployments.
