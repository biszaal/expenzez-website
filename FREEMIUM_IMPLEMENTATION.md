## Next Priority: Frontend Integration

Start by integrating UpgradeBanner and LimitReachedPrompt into:
1. `/app/(tabs)/home/index.tsx` - Home screen
2. `/app/(tabs)/ai/index.tsx` - AI chat screen
3. `/app/(tabs)/budgets/index.tsx` - Budgets page

These 3 screens are the primary places users encounter limits.
