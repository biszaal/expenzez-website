## 📊 Key Metrics

**Free Tier Generosity:**
- 10 AI chats/day = ~5% of business users' daily usage
- 5 budgets = Sufficient for personal + household + savings
- No transaction limits = Full app functionality

**Premium Incentive:**
- 50 AI chats/day = 5x upgrade (strong incentive)
- Unlimited budgets = Removes artificial constraint
- Price: £4.99/month = ~£0.10 per extra AI chat

**Expected Conversion:**
- Typical SaaS: 2-5% of free users convert to paid
- With hard limits + feature showcase: 5-10% target
- Monthly recurring revenue @ 3,000 free users: £150-300/month

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Analytics

### CloudWatch Metrics to Track
1. **Auth Middleware**
   - Subscription tier lookup success rate
   - Tier distribution (% FREE vs PREMIUM)

2. **API Limits**
   - 403 errors on budget creation
   - 403 errors on AI chat

3. **Business Metrics**
   - Free users hitting limits
   - Upgrade conversion from limit hits
   - Premium user engagement

### Recommended Alerts
- Alert if tier lookup success < 99%
- Alert if 403 errors on budget > 10/hour
- Monitor subscription webhook events
- Track trial-to-paid conversion

---

## 🚨 Known Limitations

1. **Trial End Delay**: RevenueCat webhooks have ~5-minute delay
2. **Timezone**: Limits reset at UTC midnight, not user's timezone
3. **Concurrency**: DynamoDB throttling could cause tier lookup failures (safe fallback)
4. **RevenueCat**: Sandbox vs production differences (test thoroughly)

---

## 📱 App Store Submission Notes

cd expenzez-frontend
npm run build
# or for iOS specifically:

```

**Checklist:**
