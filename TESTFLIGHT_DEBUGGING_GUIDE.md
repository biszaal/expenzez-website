# TestFlight RevenueCat Debugging Guide

## 🔍 **CURRENT STATUS CHECKLIST**

Since you submitted products on Friday and it's now Monday, let's systematically check each component:

### **1. App Store Connect Product Status** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

- [ ] Go to App Store Connect → Your App → Features → In-App Purchases
- [ ] Check if `expenzez_premium_monthly` shows **"Ready for Sale"** (not "Waiting for Review")
- [ ] Check if `expenzez_premium_yearly` shows **"Ready for Sale"** (not "Waiting for Review")
- [ ] If still "Waiting for Review", wait 24-48 hours more

### **2. RevenueCat Dashboard Configuration** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

- [ ] Go to RevenueCat Dashboard → Products
- [ ] Verify `expenzez_premium_monthly` exists and is **active**
- [ ] Verify `expenzez_premium_yearly` exists and is **active**
- [ ] Go to RevenueCat Dashboard → Offerings
- [ ] Check if "default" offering has packages added
- [ ] Verify packages are **not archived**

### **3. TestFlight Build Verification**

- [ ] Confirm you're testing the latest build (Build #71 from today)
- [ ] Check if the app was built with the correct API key
- [ ] Verify the build includes the latest RevenueCat service code

## 🚨 **MOST LIKELY ISSUES**

### **Issue 1: Products Not Approved Yet**

- **Symptom**: "No subscription options are available"
- **Cause**: Apple products still "Waiting for Review"
- **Solution**: Wait 24-48 hours, check App Store Connect

### **Issue 2: RevenueCat Offerings Not Configured**

- **Symptom**: "No subscription options are available"
- **Cause**: Products exist but not added to offerings
- **Solution**: Add products to "default" offering in RevenueCat

### **Issue 3: App Version Association**

- **Symptom**: Products approved but not working
- **Cause**: IAPs not associated with current app version
- **Solution**: Link IAPs to app version in App Store Connect

## 🔧 **DEBUGGING STEPS**

### **Step 1: Check Console Logs**

When you open the subscription page in TestFlight, check the console for:

```
🔧 [RevenueCat] Fetching production offerings...
🔧 [RevenueCat] All offerings: {...}
🔧 [RevenueCat] Current offering: default
🔧 [RevenueCat] Available packages: 2
```

### **Step 2: Verify Product IDs Match**

Ensure these match exactly:

- **App Store Connect**: `expenzez_premium_monthly`
- **RevenueCat**: `expenzez_premium_monthly`
- **Code**: `expenzez_premium_monthly`

### **Step 3: Test with Sandbox Account**

- Use a sandbox Apple ID in TestFlight
- Make sure the sandbox account is added to your app's test users
